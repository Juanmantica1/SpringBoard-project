    ">RDDs support two types of operations: transformations, which create a new dataset from an existing one, and actions, which return a value to the driver program after running a computation on the dataset. For example, map is a transformation that passes each dataset element through a function and returns a new RDD representing the results. On the other hand, reduce is an action that aggregates all the elements of the RDD using some function and returns the final result to the driver program (although there is also a parallel reduceByKey that returns a distributed dataset)."

    ">For load-balancing you'll want at least as many partitions as total computational cores in your cluster and probably rather more partitions. The Spark documentation suggests 2-4 partitions (which they also seem to call slices) per CPU. Often there are 100-10,000 partitions. Another rule of thumb is that tasks should take at least 100 ms. If less than that, you may want to repartition to have fewer partitions."
